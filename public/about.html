<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Megan. I live in the United States. I love spending time outdoors in the mountains, at a lake, etc.</p>

<p>I am currently unemployed, which is why I decided to learn to code. I would love to have a remote job that pays well enough that I might one day own a house...wish me luck!</p>

<p>I also love arts and crafts. Currently I am weaving a table runner using a 4-shaft table loom. 
  It's really fun, you can make all kinds of different weaving patterns very easily.
 I'm excited to begin the next session of weaving classes this spring, where I will learn how to use a floor loom. 
 The main difference between a table loom and a floor loom is that instead of raising the shafts with hand levers, 
 the shafts are controlled by foot pedals. It seems like it would make weaving a bit faster. 
 The only unenjoyable parts of weaving are when you have to measure out your warp yarn and then dress the loom.
  It takes hours to get set up before you can start weaving, and it's not a very straightforward process. 
  Luckily, none of my warp threads have snapped during weaving (a hazard of the craft), because fixing that problem also seems tedious.
Overall, weaving is a fun and meditative hobby and I'm very grateful that I have access to classes and instructors where I live!
